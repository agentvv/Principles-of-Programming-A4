# Principles-of-Programming-A4
Fourth assignment for my principles of programming class

The goal of this assignment was to use genetic algorithms to create a .ppm photo that looked similar to an input image.
The main.c, crossover.c and a4.h files were given, I wrote the rest.
The evolve file is the executable.

The video is a video of the evolution of the created image. It was made over 900000 generations (around 24 hours of computation time), with a population size of 500 and mutation rate of 3e-2. Every 250 generations a new frame for the video was created.
